# NestJS Skeleton

This app uses `front-end.middleware.ts` to serve the angular app when a route not containing `api` is seen.

The app also has a sample controller that serves up a message to prove communication between angular and nestjs works in dev and prod.

Small changes have been made from the default project generated by the nest cli, due to nesting the project inside another folder.
